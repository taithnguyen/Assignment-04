## Step 1: Specify the main design challenge
### What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?
This project aims to support users in their psychological needs. More specifically, this project hopes to give users a reliable way to practice proper journaling and habit tracking in order to maintain health habits in terms of mental and physical activity. 
### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
The basic need involved in this activity is mostly emotional security and safety as well as potentially self esteem needs. 
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The current solutions to satifisy these needs are either traditional journaling or other journaling/tracking apps open to the public. However, none of these current solutions are particularly optimized or useful in alleviating loads off the users' minds and facilitating a proper journaling process. 
### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
The limitations that could be improved with an optimized app/website for journaling would be making what should be a stress free process actually stress free as well as ensuring that the actual journals and habits tracked are of value. Currently, there is not enough guidance and valuable metrics tracked and technology can be utilized to fix this lack of optimization.
## Step 2: Target Users
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
The main target user for this project would be a middle aged woman who is either new to journaling/habit tracking, not technologically savvy, or both. However, the app can and should be accomodating to any given user and should be helpful to the mental and physical health of any given demographic. Furthermore, no expertise is needed whatsoever.
### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users can perform journaling in any given location or time due to its ease of use and brevity. However, it is expected that users journal in their homes at the end of the day with little to no other activities being performed. 
### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
Users simply have to either free journal using traditional methods or follow the given steps of the journal helper they are following. This involves simply following the prompt or writing down their thoughts freely. 
## Step 3: Pick research methods
For this project, I utilized participatory observation as well as interviewing the participant. I aimed to find a participant close to the target demographic and asked contextual questions to gain background knowledge and small guides towards the activity. After that, I observed the participants behaviors in the task given and then had follow up questions. The interview was conducted in my home in a quiet room. 
## Step 4: Conducting the Research
## Step 5: Reflection
